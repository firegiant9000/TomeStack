# License review: bundled SRD packs (M1 slice)

**Reviewed:** 2026-09-26 · **Route:** CC-BY-4.0 for both SRDs (owner, ADR-007) · **Attribution:** approved in [srd-attribution-draft.md](srd-attribution-draft.md) · **Packs:** `src/AppService/Content/srd-5.1.json`, `src/AppService/Content/srd-5.2.1.json` (schema `docs/schemas/content-pack.v1.schema.json`)

## Documents checked

| SRD | File | SHA-256 (matches the recorded hash) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1 | `SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf` | `2504d2a0abb0a4d491a939be4f17910a2dde0312570ab8d208080225ccf0a1f0` |
| 5.2.1 | `SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf` | `8974902d109d6e63672d7c490bde9ccf052410503d9cfa768237154fbc5e3d87` |

All text in the packs comes from these two files, nowhere else. Each source record stores the PDF hash in `sha256` (SPEC S-01). The printed page numbers equal the PDF page numbers in both files, and every revision cites its page or range in `provenance.page`.

## What was taken

| Pack | Content (kind, page) |

| SRD 5.1 | Half-Orc (species, p. 7); Acolyte (background, pp. 60–61) and its feature Shelter of the Faithful (p. 61); Barbarian levels 1–3 (class, pp. 8–9): Rage, Unarmored Defense, Reckless Attack, Danger Sense, and the six skill options; Path of the Berserker (subclass, p. 9) with Frenzy; Grappler (feat, p. 75) |

## How it was modified (recorded in each source's `modificationNotice`)

- Passages are excerpted. Descriptive text not needed for play (for example age and alignment) is left out, and some passages are shortened. Nothing is reworded to change a rule.
- Line breaks, hyphenation and PDF extraction artifacts are repaired. Some em dashes became commas or parentheses.
- Rules are encoded as effects: ability increases, proficiencies, a hit die, level-gated grants, choices, resources and recoveries, an armor class alternative, and a prerequisite.
- Clearly marked TomeStack notes are added where the data needs one, for example "TomeStack slice: levels 1–3", or "the formula matches the table for levels 1–11".

## What was not taken

No art, logos, trade dress, product names or other publications. No monsters, spells or magic items. Nothing outside the two checked PDFs.

## Attribution placement and judgment calls

- `attribution` holds the approved statement **verbatim**. `SrdPackTests` compares it with the approval page.
- `modificationNotice` is separate so the attribution stays unchanged. Both travel into package `notices[]`.
- **Judgment call for the owner:** each SRD source's `publisher` is "SRD 5.1 (CC-BY-4.0)" or "SRD 5.2.1 (CC-BY-4.0)", not the rights holder's name. Both legal pages ask for "no other attribution" beyond the statement, so the rights holder is named only inside the statement. If the owner reads the request differently, only this field changes.
- `ATTRIBUTION.md` and `NOTICE` carry both statements and the modification notice, and the installer ships them.
- The in-app About / Sources screen is M2.

## Known limitations of the encoded rules

- "None of these increases can raise a score above 20" (5.2.1 background ability scores) is not enforced by the calculator yet. It is shown in the choice text. It does not affect characters below 19 in a score.
- Rages use `min(2 + floor(CLASS_LEVEL / 3), 4)`, which matches both tables for levels 1–11. The slice is levels 1–3.
- Unarmored Defense assumes no armor is worn, because armor is not modeled (M2 equipment). Its trace says so.
- Frenzy (5.2.1) offers a 2d6 roll for Rage Damage +2 (Barbarian levels 1–8).
- Advantage-granting features (Rage, Danger Sense, Reckless Attack) stay text only. Since M2 item 2, the sheet shows them as reference-only features, and the player picks advantage for the roll.
